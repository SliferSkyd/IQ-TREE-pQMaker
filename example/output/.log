IQ-TREE MPI multicore version 2.0.6 for Linux 64-bit built Jan 25 2024
Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    TURING (AVX2, FMA3, 6 GB RAM)
Command: ./iqtree2-mpi -S ../example/test -nt 1 -pre ../example/output/ -redo -np 4
Seed:    498326 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Jan 26 00:38:35 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (16 CPU cores detected)
MPI:     1 processes

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 16 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
